## Choices that I have made

- I use React as the framework because I feel React is my most convenient and go-to JS framework and to allow easy state management and DOM manipulation. Although I am open to learning other frameworks
- I use material-ui components as it provides a clear and thorough docs for building basic UI components
- Redux is my choice for state management, although in this case i think it is a bit of overkill since it is quite a simple app

## Future Improvements Needed

- Improve further on unit tests
- Of course, next and previous buttons or an infinite scroll (when user scroll, it loads more)
- Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript
- Enhance / improve the UI
